<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abel Carvalho</h1>
<h3 align="left">Python Backend Developer from Brazil</h3>

I am Abel, and I am here to learn and succeed. I started delving into software development as an enthusiast around 2016/17. I have always had a great curiosity for learning new things until I stumbled upon something that resonated with me deeply - that's when I discovered Python.

I am pursuing this career because, above all, I believe that technology is a tool for saving time and enhancing efficiency for humanity, leading to significant transformations.

I have gained one year of experience working as a backend developer, primarily using Python to craft APIs. Along the way, I also acquired knowledge about serverless concepts and AWS resources, such as lambdas. Additionally, I have experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. I have completed courses on the Django framework, as well as agile methodologies, from Kanban to Scrum, and version control. I must also mention that I am an enthusiast of the Laravel framework in the PHP realm.

I understand that success can be challenging, but the key lies in persistence and the acquisition of hard and soft skills.

I am open to suggestions and opportunities, whether freelance or effective. I also have to say that I am graduating from the Faculty of Systems Analysis and Development.
