<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abel Carvalho</h1>
<h3 align="left">Python Developer from Brazil</h3>

Graduating in the course of Systems Analysis and Development, focusing on Back-End Developer, with the objective of creating applications, managing software versions, planning, proposing, and assisting with the definition of the architecture of the systems under development.

I have already developed projects in college with agile methodologies, in question Scrum, when I worked as a back-end developer for the first time, I met Kanban, and lastly I worked with the "scrumban" concept, as I started using Jira.

I learned unit testing with Python (pytest) in addition to the Python language itself with the help of a lot of research and online courses, but also with professional experience. I have basic knowledge of JavaScript and Retool. I learned how to use AWS Cloud and Serverless framework, I also know how to use Django, Flask and FastAPI frameworks, either in REST or SOUP architecture, I'm learning SOLID. I am open to feedbacks and I believe that feedbacks are tools for improvement.
